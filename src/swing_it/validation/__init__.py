"""swing_it.validation — signal-agnostic out-of-sample validation primitives.

Walk-forward folds, one-at-a-time sensitivity sweeps, and robust Bayesian
optimization, extracted from one-off research scripts so every alpha reuses the
same anti-overfit machinery instead of re-deriving it.

A leaf package like ``engine``: it takes GENERIC inputs — arrays of returns +
entry-dates and a ``simulate(params) -> (returns, entry_dates)`` callable — and
imports NOTHING from ``research/``. The signal-specific wiring stays in research.

Two non-negotiables carried over from the research methodology:
    - **No-lookahead:** ``FOLDS`` is a frozen default (``rolling_folds()``); folds
      fit on TRAIN, evaluate on OOS. Not a per-experiment knob → no fold-shopping.
    - **Robust objective:** ``make_objective`` maximizes the bootstrap 2.5% lower
      bound (``_boot_lower``), never the raw mean. This is sacred.

    sensitivity  <- bo_validate.{run_sensitivity, run_explore}
