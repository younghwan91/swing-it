"""Inverse-ETF market hedge — the deployable substitute for an individual short leg.

**Why this exists.** The validated PEAD (and low-vol) edge is a dollar-neutral
long/short book, and robustness testing showed most of PEAD's edge lives in the
*short* leg (raise the liquidity floor and the long-only excess dies:
t≈0.48 at 50억). But a retail Korean account often **cannot short individual
names** — it can only buy an inverse index ETF (KODEX 인버스 = −1× KOSPI200,
252670 = −2×). This module builds the implementable form: hold the long book of
individual stocks and neutralize *market beta* by buying an inverse ETF, instead
of shorting individual stocks.

The trade-off is explicit and must be reported: an inverse ETF removes only the
**market** component of risk/return, so any *stock-specific* short alpha (the
lottery-stock short in low-vol, the negative-surprise short in PEAD) is left on
the table. This is why the hedged form is the honest *deployable* spec while the
individual-short L/S is the theoretical *ceiling*.

⚠️ **Synthetic inverse.** swing-it's ``daily_bars_adjusted`` holds individual
stocks only — no ETF bars over 2016–2026. So the inverse leg is *synthesized*
from the market proxy: ``r_inverse = −leverage × r_market − fee``. A real KODEX
인버스 also carries futures-roll and tracking drag beyond its ~0.64%/yr TER, so
the synthetic hedge is a mild *upper* bound on the hedged book. The combo deployment book — reproduced
performance tables and fitted weights — is kept out of this public repo; only the
library and its tests live here.

Pure Series in -> Series out (no DB), unit-testable.
